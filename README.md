# Denial Of Service Attack
--Disclaimer
I am not responsible for your actions!
Use this script at your own risk! What you decide to do with it is not my problem!
You download it! You take responsiblibity for it!

--Information on the two protocols and why I choose UDP over TCP:
TCP: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment
UDP: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol

--About the Denial of Service tool
How fast the tool sends the data really depends on your internet and PC but once you get it dialed in with what you do have you'd be surprised what this code can do! I've gotten 800-900+ Mbps average out of it. Keep in mind that's 8-9+ times my internet speed (download)!
So shoot for 8-9 times you internet speed or it also depend on how many processes your using for the program.
