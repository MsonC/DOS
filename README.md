It depends on your internet and PC but once you get it dialed in you'd be suprised what this code can do!
I've gotten 800-900 Mbps average out of it. Keep in mind thats 9 times my internet speed!
So shoot for 8-9 times you internet speed or it also depend on how many processes your using in the program.
