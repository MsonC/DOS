# Denial Of Service Attack
--Explanation on why it works
UDP has no handshake therfor easier to send tons of data at once. TCP on the other hand uses a 3-way handshake (simpified from wikipedia)  

--Disclaimer

UDP: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol

--About the Denial of Service tool
How fast the tool sends the data really depends on your internet and PC but once you get it dialed in with what you do have you'd be surprised what this code can do! I've gotten 800-900 Mbps average out of it. Keep in mind that's 9 times my internet speed (download)!
So shoot for 8-9 times you internet speed or it also depend on how many processes your using in the program.
