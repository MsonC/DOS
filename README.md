# Denial Of Service Attack
--About
Since some of the other Denial of service tools that's use the same concept I use are fake on GitHub or just don't work I thought I'd make a real working Denial of service tool!

--Explanation on why it works
The reason why there tool does not work and mine does (for this specific purpose/flooding) They are using TCP NOT UDP while my code is using UDP. TCP Has a handshake (authentication) where UDP has none whatsoever and packets could even get lost in the process but that is why its so good for this purpose. Since we are not authenticating WHY WOULD WE USE TCP? 

--Disclaimer
Use this tool at your own risk I am not responsible for your actions!
You download it! You take responsibility for it!

--About the Denial of Service tool
How fast the tool sends the data really depends on your internet and PC but once you get it dialed in with what you do have you'd be surprised what this code can do! I've gotten 800-900 Mbps average out of it. Keep in mind that's 9 times my internet speed (download)!
So shoot for 8-9 times you internet speed or it also depend on how many processes your using in the program.
